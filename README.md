# algorithms
A place to play with algorithms, various coding challenges, and document stuff along the way. May contain various languages, but mainly Python for now

## Python
 - It's highly recommended to use a virtual env, but feel free to use whatever Python3 setup fits your fancy

### Install Dependencies
```python
  # Do this before trying to run code or launch docs
  # Run at root of project
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Running the Language Docs locally
  ```bash
    cd python/language_docs/docs
    mkdocs serve
    # Docs will launch at http://127.0.0.1:8000
  ```
